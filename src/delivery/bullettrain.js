// ============================================================================
// BULLET TRAIN - one of the mystery pickup's effects. A bullet train turns up the road in the
// player's lane, where new traffic turns up, and comes straight down that lane the wrong way,
// far faster than anything else, reaching where the player was about CONFIG.bulletTrain.warning
// seconds later. Whatever any part of it touches is destroyed: traffic, obstacles, and the
// player's car, outright (like the bridge structure), nose on or steered into its side; only
// a ghost passes through it. It keeps to its lane, following it where the road narrows, and
// is gone once it is well past. While it is about, the shoulder's danger meter runs down slower,
// and until CONFIG.bulletTrain.mercyAfter s after it has gone nobody is busted for being on the
// shoulder (see Player.update and Player.bust): it may be the only way out of its path.
// This is the movement and the damage; render/bullettrain.js draws it.
