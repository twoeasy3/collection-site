// THEMES - the looks a level can have (its "theme" field): the colours of its sky, ground and road, and the
// scenery beside it (drawn by render/road.js, by `scenery`). Only the data, nothing drawn here: so the game
// and the editor both read the one list. Any theme can go on any level (?theme=snow in the address tries one
// on the level picked): what a theme's scenery makes of something a level may have of its own (a runway,
// zones, landmarks, grandstands) it does without where the level has none.
// fogColor: the colour of a fog bank (a level's "fog") in this theme, if not the one worked out from its sky (pale grey
// under a bright sky, mostly the sky's own colour under a dark one: see CONFIG.fog and render/roadside.js).
// channel: { shallow, deep, glint }: the colours of the water of a water stage (a level's "water": see
// render/water.js) in this theme, if not CONFIG.water.colours: a harbour at night, a muddy river, a fjord, a flood.
// river: the colour of what runs under a drawbridge in this theme (render/hazards.js), if not its channel's deep water,
// nor the usual blue; riverCore: a brighter band down its middle (lava).
// target: { offset, height, style, base, arm, beam }: how this theme's TANK RAGE targets stand (see CONFIG.target and
// Targets in pickups.js), where the usual post 5 m beyond the pavement would be hidden: in front of a wall of
// buildings, on top of a parapet or a catch fence, hung out over the shoulder. A theme without one gets the usual.

// same box, the same cost, in the same place, only the thing itself belonging to where it is (see Collision's
// loadLevel, CONFIG.obstacleKinds and render/obstacleModels.js). A kind the theme does not name is itself; so is
// whatever a gimmick puts out (a cargo truck's load is crates and bales everywhere). A level that wants one of
// these on another theme names it outright ("kind": "barrel"). Kept apart from the list above, one theme a line.

// there a cone is the right thing, and stays (the suburbs, the city).
