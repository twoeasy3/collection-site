// ============================================================================
// RACE WATCH - the second screensaver: a race on a circuit, watched as on TV. No player car (the
// player is out of play, following whichever car is being watched, so that what is shown is
// what is near it). The racers get a driver each, a cartoon name; their split from the leader is
// timed at every checkpoint (every CP m round the lap). A racer wrecked within CONFIG.race.killWindow
// s of another hitting it is that one's wreck: each racer's wrecks caused and times wrecked are both counted.
// Every so often the coverage cuts to another car: the closest battle, the leader, or anyone, and to
// another camera (see render/racewatch.js). Once the leader has taken the flag, and the rest have
// had a while to follow, a new race starts.
