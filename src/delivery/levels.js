// ============================================================================
// LEVELS - plain data, one JSON file per level in ./levels// live in its own .json file. Everything is positioned by distance along the road, in metres
// from the start line, plus a lane number; nothing is in world coordinates.
//   segments   the expressway's shape: length (m), curve (radians per metre, + = right; a hairpin
//              is a bend turning pi radians, no tighter than the road is wide) and,
//              optionally, grade (rise per metre: 0.03 is a 3% climb, negative goes downhill).
//              A side road follows the land (exactly as high as the expressway where it runs beside it; away from it, a
//              slope of its own, no steeper than CONFIG.ramps.steepest) and a flyover stands on it. Bridges must be on level road.
//   drive      'right' (default) or 'left': the side the traffic keeps to. Everything else in the
//              level is written as if driving on the right (lanes, exits, turns, sides), and a
//              left-hand level is shown as its mirror image: a "right" turn is seen as a left one
//   junctions  { s, turn, forward, turnOff }: a crossroads, its bend (or box) starting at s; turn:
//              'left' | 'right' (the road turns a quarter there: the level's segments must have the
//              bend) or 'straight'. See CONFIG.junction
//   lanes      the expressway's lanes: a number, half each side of the centre line, an odd one
//              over on the right (default CONFIG.laneCount); or { north, south }: how many on the
//              right, going the player's way, and on the left, oncoming
//   median     neutral lanes down the middle of a two-way road, which no traffic uses
//   railway    { every: { min, max } }: a railway down the median (it needs one), with a bullet
//              train coming through, against the player, every min-max s
//   flow       'north' = every vehicle goes the player's way, 'south' = every vehicle comes
//              the other way; either way the traffic uses all the lanes. 'mixed' = both ways, and
//              every lane open to either (the Battlefield: oncoming traffic in every lane). Left out, the left
//              half of the road is oncoming. A one-way level's exits can't have flyovers (a flyover brings
//              oncoming traffic over from the expressway's oncoming side, and a one-way road has none). On a
//              'south' level only the player takes an exit: its side road has traffic of its own only with oncoming: true.
//   shoulderRows  { kind, from, to, every, side } a row of obstacles standing on the
//              shoulder, one every `every` metres. kind: 'cone' | 'sign' (or any obstacle
//              kind); side: 'left' | 'right' | 'both' (default). Exit and merge lanes are left clear.
//   shoulderTimer  false = no danger timer: the shoulders can be driven on freely, and
//              police cars don't bust for it either; 'mud' = the same, but only in the level's mud
//   helicopter false = the rescue and police helicopters are not drawn (they still act)
//   narrows    stretches where each side of the expressway drops to `lanesPerSide` lanes; with side: 'left' or
//              'right', only that side does (the level's "lanes" are the most each way ever has: a way that
//              gains a lane further on is narrowed until then)
//   splits     { from, to, apart? }: a two-way road's two ways part: the oncoming side swings away to the left,
//              runs on by itself `apart` m off (CONFIG.split.apart if not said), and comes back in. Nothing
//              crosses the centre line while they are apart
//   bridges    stretches where a bridge's structure stands on both shoulders
//   exits      side roads: an exit lane opens beside the right-hand lane before `exitAt`,
//              where the side road forks off; it comes back as a merge lane at `mergeAt`.
//              The side road's shape is worked out from those two points, so it always
//              joins up; the expressway has to swing away in between. Whatever the expressway does, the
//              side road parts from it as a real one does: CONFIG.ramps.apart m or more from its lanes,
//              that gap opening over ramps.part m from the fork and closing over as many to the merge
//              (the fork's and the merge's markings, nose and chevrons: see render/road.js).
//              Its shoulders are as wide as the level's, and the theme's scenery keeps off it.
//              Whatever a level puts at a place can be on a side road: { ..., road: 'side', exit: n } (n: which
//              exit, 0 if not said), its s (or from and to) then m along the side road. Pickups and obstacles
//              (lane: any of its lanes open there, 0 to 3, or 'left' / 'right', its shoulders), targets,
//              tractors, herds, frogs, dropBears, landmines, rockfall, pelotons, migration, cameras,
//              crossings, potholes, and the hazards of hazards.js (schoolCrossings, drawbridges, waterMains,
//              balloons, wideLoads, marathons, trolleys, stampedes). Not (the level reports it): ice, mud, fog,
//              stopGo, parked, roadblocks, iceCreamStops, reversible, wreckage, machinery, siteWorks, parades,
//              hippos, elephants, quarries, tunnels and bridges, which are made for the expressway's lanes.
//              An exit can shape its side road (see track.js): out: m its middle is pushed out, away from
//              the expressway; bends: { count, size }: that many bends in a row, each `size` m off its line.
//              Or segments: [{ length, curve }], as the level's own, from the exit on: the side road follows
//              them, and a curve of its own making brings it from where they end to the merge.
//              lanes: how many lanes wide it is between its ramps (2 if not said, 4 at most), or
//              [{ at, count }] to widen and narrow it along the way (at: m along the side road).
//              oncomingFrom: m along it from which its left lane (lane 0) is oncoming and the double yellow
//              line is drawn; before that, every lane goes the player's way.
//              oncoming: true / false: whether its other lane carries traffic coming the other way (if not
//              said: on a two-way level it does, on a one-way one it doesn't). That traffic just turns up at
//              one end and is gone at the other, unless the exit has flyovers: true (a two-way level only):
//              a flyover at each end carries it over from the expressway and back, and the expressway then
//              has to be straight for 250 m before the exit and after the merge (room for them).
//              Limits the level reports: the merge at least 2 ramps and 100 m after the exit; bends no tighter than
//              CONFIG.ramps.tightest; 9 km long at most; 1 to 4 lanes, only lane 0 ever oncoming; no bridge,
//              narrowing or tunnel over its ramps; no exit on a level with a tide.
//   pickups    { type, s, lane }   type: turbo | ghost | wrench | passenger | mystery | radarDetector | siren
//                                       | badGas | heavyMass | timePlus | timeMinus
//   theme      'city' (default), 'bathurst' (Mount Panorama: a mountain), 'panorama' (the same, as a road through the bush), 'montreal' (Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve's island: its landmarks 'river', 'basin',
//              'casino', 'biosphere', 'skyline'), 'sea' (open water, unmarked, the edges blocked by rocks and buoys), 'farm', 'beach', 'suburb', 'canberra', 'snow', 'singapore', 'singaporeNight', 'coast' (in zones), 'safari' (in zones: a dirt road, unmarked), 'airport', 'construction', 'flooded' (the city under flood water, in the rain), 'hell' or 'space': the look of the ground, sky and roadside.
//              'snow' is a mountainside: land that climbs and falls with the road and fills in between its switchbacks.
//              In space there is no ground and no road surface, only the lane lines.
//   car        a special vehicle the level is driven in whatever is in the garage ('ufo', 'f1')
//   alwaysGood true = the player is Good on it, whatever the side picked on the menu (as on the Battlefield)
//   grid       { count, kind, gap, pace: { min, max }, from }: a race. `count` cars of that kind on a
//              grid, two by two, `gap` m apart, ahead of the player, all the player's way, half of them
//              evil, each at its own share (pace) of the player's car's top speed; they race on,
//              never recycled. (The HUD shows the player's position.) A race usually also has:
//   noPackages true = nobody throws packages
//   understeer true = every car understeers in bends as on ice (and none slows for a bend by itself)
//   wallDamage true = a car going sideways into the road's edge takes damage (see CONFIG.race)
//   nudge      true = a car steering into another's side knocks it aside
//   landmarks  { kind, x, z, r, rot }: landmarks where they really are, in the world (Singapore's look:

//              'artscience', 'helix' (r: half its length), 'float', 'cbd', 'suntec', 'gallery', 'domes'); r m

//              every: { min, max } s between bursts, if not CONFIG.gunfire.every
//   rival      'opposite' | 'evil' | 'good': a rival courier races the player to the drop (see Game.start;
//              ?rival puts one on any delivery level, to try it out)
//   rivals     [{ name, car, colors: ['#body', '#stripe'], mark: '#marker' }]: up to three rival couriers
//              (each on the level's "rival" side), with names, cars and colour schemes of their own
//   shoulder   m of shoulder each side of the road, if not CONFIG.shoulder (a street circuit's walls close by)
//   runoff     { from, to, side, width }: the shoulder on that side `width` m wider over that stretch (run-off
//              on the outside of a corner, where a circuit has it), easing in and out
//   stands     { from, to, side, pits }: grandstands along that stretch (pits: the pit garages instead)
//   laps       the number of laps of a race round a circuit: the road must come back round to where it
//              starts, facing the same way (a closed loop, checked as the level loads)
//   traffic    which vehicles turn up as traffic and how often, relative to each other:
//              { "darkvan": 0.44, "van": 0.18, "police": 0.1 }. The kinds are those in
//              CONFIG.vehicles. An empty list ({}) means no traffic at all.
//              Keep the police light (a share of about 0.03 to 0.04): the levels from Speed Trap Alley on do.
//              For a stretch with no police at all (and a buffer either side, so none can see into it), give
//              the police only in trafficZones round it: a police car stays on station at a zone's edge
//   trafficCount, oncomingCount  how many vehicles are about at once, each way (defaults in
//              CONFIG; together no more than CONFIG.trafficPool)
//   drivers    { evil, happy, angry }: the share of drivers that are evil, and the chance a
//              driver starts out happy or angry (defaults: CONFIG.evilShare and startMood); or for

//   hesitation false = traffic too fast for the player never hesitates, and none comes up from

//   asteroidFields  { from, to, count, moving, seed }: `count` asteroids of assorted sizes
//              scattered over that stretch, the same every run for a given seed. About half
//              sit at road level; the rest pass just under or over it, unmarked. `moving` is the share that
//              drift across the road or bob up and down through it.
//   (an obstacle's or a pickup's lane can also be 'left' or 'right': on that shoulder)
//   obstacles  { s, lane, kind }   things on the road that explode when hit. kind: 'barrier'

//   dropBears  { from, to, count } drop bears up in the trees over that stretch, dropping onto the
//              road as the player comes near (see CONFIG.dropBear)
//   herds      { from, to, count, kind } animals wandering back and forth across that stretch: cows,
//                                  or (kind: 'kangaroo') kangaroos bounding across, with a warning sign before
//   drifters   { from, to, kind, count, pattern } obstacles of that kind moving about the road
//              in a pattern: 'circle', 'zigzag' (along the road, weaving), 'sweep' (across
//              and back), 'figure8' or 'dart' (no pattern: sitting, then darting off anywhere
//              across, at random: see CONFIG.drifters). They are hit like any obstacle of their kind.
//   storm      { from, to, count, seed } vehicles blown through the air above that stretch,
//              tumbling, looping round when they reach its end. Only a sight: nothing can hit them.
//   tractors   { s, lane }         a tractor: slow traffic that starts from that spot every run
//   parked     { s, side }         a car parked on that shoulder ('left' | 'right'), hazards on, every run
//   zones      { id, from, to, scenery, ground, sky, sea }: stretches of the level with a look of their
//              own (on a level whose theme is 'zones': see render/road.js). The player is welcomed into
//              each (messages.json: zones, by id). (Their traffic: see trafficZones)
//   quietZones [{ from, to, density }]: stretches with less traffic (a narrow bridge with no shoulder): only
//              `density` (0-1) of the cars that would turn up there do; the rest turn up elsewhere
//   trafficZones [{ from, to, traffic: { kind: weight } }]: stretches where the traffic turning up is
//              different: each sets the weights of the kinds it names over the level's "traffic" (0 takes
//              a kind away), a later one over an earlier. With police only in such stretches, a police
//              car stays on station at the edge of its stretch (The Hood)
//   ice        { from, to, lane }  an ice patch on that lane (no lane: across the road) (see CONFIG.ice)
//   tide       { from, to, start, end, waves: { every: { min, max }, reach: { min, max } } }: a causeway
//              the sea comes in over, on the player's side of the road only, from the kerb in. It
//              floods `start` lane widths in from the pavement's edge (the shoulder counts as one)
//              at the start of a run, rising to `end` as the clock runs down; every min-max s a
//              wave (warned of) floods a stretch `reach` lanes further for a few seconds, then
//              drains right out, leaving the road bare a while. washUp: { types: { type: share },
//              count: { min, max } }: pickups each wave leaves in the water. On a two-way road
//              with no exits. See tide.js and CONFIG.tide
//   water      [{ from, to, current? }]: water stages: over each stretch the road IS water: the pavement runs down a
//              slipway into a channel as wide as the road and back up one at the far end, the lanes carrying on as
//              lanes, marked by buoys. A car that floats drives in at speed and goes on as a boat (slower, softer
//              to steer: nothing stops it); traffic that can't float waits in a queue on its own shoulder short of
//              the water, every lane left open; amphibious traffic (a vehicle's "amphibious") drives in and out;
//              boats (a vehicle's "boat") are only ever on the water, and tie up at its bank at the end of it.
//              current: m/s^2 the water carries a car afloat sideways (+ = to the right). from below 0 or to beyond
//              the finish: a level that starts, or ends, afloat. On level road, clear of exits, junctions, splits
//              and tunnels, each 78 m long at least, and only on an amphibious level. See water.js, CONFIG.water
//   amphibious true = an amphibious level: it can only be started in an amphibious car (a car's "amphibious": the
//              garage's Amphibious section), whichever of them the player owns and picks; the menu says so
//   frogs      { from, to }        a stretch of road that a large frog roams all over
//   mud        { from, to }        a stretch where the road gives way to mud: a car is slowed in it as
//                                  on a railway track, by how well it crosses (see CONFIG.mud)
//   potties    { s, pattern, lanes, period, phase }: a row of portaloos across those lanes, dancing
//              together: 'hop', 'wave', 'slide', 'shuffle', 'stomp' or 'spin' (see Collision; obstacles,
//              blown open when hit, and passed underneath while up in the air)
//   machinery  { s, kind }         a bulldozer, excavator or dumpTruck trundling across the road and back
//                                  there: solid, a heavy knock to run into (see machinery.js); or a
//                                  { kind: 'roller', from, to, side } crawling along a shoulder, or a
//                                  { kind: 'forklift', s, side } backing out onto one and off again
//   siteWorks  { kind, ... }       the work on a construction site's shoulders: trenches, swinging
//                                  excavators, workers with barrows, stacks of pipes (see site.js)
//   migration  { from, to, count, kinds: { kind: share }, dir }: a great herd (kinds: 'wildebeest',
//              'zebra') streaming across the road over that stretch, one way (dir: 1 = to the
//              right), and round again: obstacles, blown up when hit (see CONFIG.migration)
//   elephants  { from, to, count }: elephants plodding across the road and back over that stretch:
//              whatever one walks into is destroyed, traffic included (see elephants.js)
//   wreckage   { at, kind, lanes: [first, last], from, trigger, slide }: scripted destruction, set off
//              as the player comes within trigger m (default CONFIG.wreckage.trigger): something goes
//              up beside the road (from: 'left' | 'right') or falls out of the sky ('sky'), and its
//              wreckage lands across those lanes at `at`, wrecking all there, blocking them for good.
//              kind: 'tanker' | 'containers' | 'boulders' | 'hangar' | 'plane' | 'airliner' (an airliner comes in
//              to land `slide` m beyond `at` and slides back to it). Traffic pulls over for it.
//              Or 'blast': a building `distance` m off the road on its side (from) blows out across
//              its lanes out to the road's edge, wrecking all there just then, and leaves the road clear;
//              it goes by the player's pace (see CONFIG.wreckage.blastWarn), not a trigger: with
//              "ahead" (s), that much sooner, out of the player's reach unless the player speeds up.
//              rock: true makes a blast a quarry's: a crag of the rock face blasted out, rock and dust, not a building
//   quarries   { from, to, side, floor? }: (the construction theme) a quarry beside the road over that stretch, on that
//              side ('left' | 'right'): its floor, its rock face cut back in benches, crusher, heaps and trucks
//              (only scenery; see CONFIG.quarry). floor: m off the road its face starts, if not CONFIG.quarry.floorTo
//              (a face close in has no room on its floor for the works). A blast with rock: true (see wreckage) blows its face out
//   runway     { from, width }: from there on the road is a runway, `width` m of concrete beyond each
//              edge, with a runway's markings in place of lanes (the airport's look)
//   tower      { at, trigger, distance, stub }: the control tower, beside the old road carrying
//              straight on (stub m of it) where the route turns off at `at`; set off at trigger m
//              short of there, it comes crashing down across that road (only a sight)
//   parkedPlanes  { s, d, turn }: airliners parked d m off the road on the left, turned a little
//   cameras    { s, side, limit }: a speed camera on its pole, on a shoulder (side 'left' | 'right') or
//              on the centre line ('centre'); limit in km/h (default the level's speedLimit, or else
//              CONFIG.speedCamera.limit). Passing it faster is a fine the first time in a run (by how far
//              over: CONFIG.speedCamera.fines), a bust after; run over, it's no offence
//   speedLimit km/h: the limit at the level's speed cameras, where a camera doesn't say
//   processions  { every: { min, max } }: now and then a funeral procession, a hearse and its cars,
//              slow, nose to tail (see CONFIG.procession)
//   crossings  { s, trigger, every }: a level crossing: lights, booms, and a short fast train across
//              the road, set off so the train gets there about as the player would (see CONFIG.crossing),
//              or with a trigger, as the player comes within that many m. On straight road
//   stopGo     { from, to, go?, clear? }: stop / go roadworks on a two-way road: the oncoming side dug up
//              over that stretch (as long as it likes), both ways taking turns through the lane left. go: s
//              each way gets the GO; clear: s between, for the last through to clear (a long works wants
//              longer), if not CONFIG.stopGo's. On straight road
//   fog        { from, to }: a fog bank: the fog closes right in, and the police see less (see CONFIG.fog)
//   tunnels    { from, to }: a tunnel: the road under cover, dark but for its lamps, the player's headlights on
//              and the engine echoing (see CONFIG.tunnel and render/tunnel.js). Clear of any exit's ramps
//   waterMains { s, lane?, every? }: a burst water main in that lane (no lane: the centre line): now and then
//              a geyser up out of the road, and while it sprays the road round it is as slippery as ice
//              (see watermains.js and CONFIG.waterMain); every: { min, max } s between bursts, if not CONFIG's
//   (a herd, "herds", with stay: true never leaves the road: it turns back at the lane lines, and never rests)
//   parades    { s, speed? }: a street parade at s: a float in every lane of the player's side, abreast, a marching
//              band behind, all off at a crawl the player's way as the player comes near, taking the whole road
//              (see CONFIG.parade). A bandsman knocked down in front of the police is a bust
//   roadblocks { s, gap? }: a police roadblock: police cars across every lane of the player's side but one (gap:
//              which; left out, any, each run). Touching one is a bust, unless the car has a radar detector; with
//              a siren going the police pull aside and wave the player through (see CONFIG.roadblock)
//   (a traffic kind that sheds, "cargotruck", drops crates, bales and tyres off the back as it goes, a little
//              way ahead of the player: obstacles, sliding on and stopping. See CONFIG.cargo)
//   iceCreamStops { s, lane, wait? }: an ice-cream van stopped in that lane, its jingle going; the traffic behind it
//              queues, nobody pulling out round it, until it drives off, `wait` s after the player comes near
//              (see CONFIG.iceCream)
//   reversible { from, to, lane, flipAt? }: a reversible lane on the player's side (a two-way road): as the player
//              comes within flipAt m its overhead signs go from a green arrow to a red cross and it is oncoming
//              from then on: the traffic in it moves out, and cars come down it the wrong way (see CONFIG.reversible)
//   convoys    { every: { min, max }, size?, kind? }: now and then a convoy, `size` vehicles of a kind nose to tail
//              in one lane, moving as one and shutting their gaps in the player's face (see CONFIG.convoy)
//   (everywhere: the traffic slows to look at a wreck for a while after, so the jam comes after the crash, and an
//              evil driver stuck in it may go up the shoulder, to be arrested if the police see: CONFIG.rubberneck)
//   potholes   { s, lane, r }: a pothole in that lane (r: its radius, m): a jolt, and maybe a flat tyre
//   rockfall   { from, to, count, side, out?, height? }: rocks tumbling down onto the road from that side as the player
//              comes near: obstacles, which only the player hits (see CONFIG.rockfall). out / height: where they wait,
//              m off the road's edge and m up, if not CONFIG.rockfall's (the hillside's): on a quarry's bench, say
//   (Gimmick Road 2's: see hazards.js and CONFIG, each under its own name. Any can be on a side road, as cameras,
//   crossings and potholes can: { road: 'side', exit: n }, s then m along that side road)
//   schoolCrossings { s }: a lollipop person stops the traffic for the children; running it is a bust
//   waterMains { s, lane, length? }: a burst main: that stretch of the lane is as slippery as ice while it sprays
//   balloons   { s, lanes: [first, last] }: a hot-air balloon comes down on those lanes, sits, and lifts off again
//   drawbridges { s }: bells, booms, and two leaves that lift: the car goes up the near one and jumps the gap if it
//              came fast enough (a board gives the speed), or stops short, or drops in. On straight road
//   wideLoads  { s, lanes: [n, n + 1] }: a load two lanes wide crawling along; passing it while its escort watches is a bust
//   trolleys   { from, to, count }: shopping trolleys rolling across the road with its camber
//   marathons  { s, lane, count, water? }: runners in one lane behind a pace car; water: where its water station stands
//   stampedes  { from, to, count, kind: 'cow' | 'kangaroo' }: animals charging down the road at the player
//   (and wreckage of kind 'roadtrain': a road train jackknifing across its lanes)
//   pelotons   { s, count, speed, trigger, dir }: cyclists two abreast by the kerb on the player's side,
//              setting off as the player comes near: obstacles, which only the player hits (see CONFIG.peloton).
//              dir -1: on the far side instead, riding towards the player (the bunch strung out behind
//              them, past s)
//   battle     true = the Battlefield: two armies at war down the road (see CONFIG.battle). Its traffic
//              going the player's way is the player's side, green (good, whatever the player's side
//              on the menu); coming the other way, the enemy's, red (evil). Best with "flow": "mixed"
//   landmines  { from, to, count }: landmines scattered down the lanes over that stretch, their lights
//              flashing: whatever touches one, the player's car or traffic, is destroyed outright (a ghost
//              passes over), and the mine with it. Traffic never steers round them
//   pillboxes  true = (with battle) pillboxes beside the road every CONFIG.battle.pillboxEvery m, half
//              each army's, firing bursts at the other's vehicles (as The Hood's gang houses)
//   hippos     { from, to, every: { min, max } }: a river beside the road (on the right) over that
//              stretch, out of which a hippo charges across the road every min-max s, aimed at the
//              player: whatever it touches is destroyed, and it carries on (see hippos.js)
//   id         unique name, used as the level's key in saved progress
//   targets    { s, side }         TANK RAGE targets beside the road; side: 'left' | 'right'
//   clock      { good, evil }: seconds on the clock for each side. Worked out from a clean run in the
//              reference car by scripts/level-clocks.mjs (see CONFIG.clock), unless set by hand
//   tip        the money earned for finishing before the clock reaches zero
//              Lane 0 is the far left (oncoming). Add road: 'side' to put an item on a side
//              road (and exit: n for the nth exit's): s from its start, lane 0 oncoming / 1 ours.
// A level is checked as it loads; problems are shown on screen and in the console.
// To add a level: add a .json file to ./levels, import it here and add it to MAIN_LEVELS (or
// SPECIAL_LEVELS). Putting one in among those already there changes the positions saved progress
// counts by: see LEVEL_ORDER in progress.js.
