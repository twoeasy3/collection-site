      <h3>The shoulder meter</h3>
      <p>On a level with the shoulder rule, the red <strong>SHOULDER - POLICE</strong> bar shows while you're on the shoulder, with beeps that speed up as it runs down. Get back in a lane and it refills. Some levels (the construction site among them) switch the rule off entirely.</p>

  <p>Touching a police car is a bust, unless it wasn't your fault. You're in the clear if the police car:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>ran into the <strong>back</strong> of you,</li>
      <li><strong>turned into</strong> you (it was moving sideways towards you, faster than ${C.policeTurnIn} m/s and faster than you were moving towards it),</li>
      <li>was <strong>out of control</strong>: spinning or wobbling from a critical hit,</li>
      <li>or was coming the <strong>other way</strong> (a head-on is a crash, not an offence).</li>
