// ---- THE DELIVERY: a level delivered, the cargo is set down at the kerb before the results ------
// Game.finish has already fixed the run (its time, outcome, tip and records) and the state is
// 'finished'; this only holds the results screen back for a few seconds while, by the clock here:
//   park     the car brakes to a stop at the kerb on its own side (a ghost: nothing ploughs into it),
//   unload   the cargo comes out of it and is set down on the kerbside,
//   moment   it has a moment of its own (an Evil one in whatever state it had got to),
//   and after a beat the results come up (Delivery.done calls back to Game).
// A key, tap or click skips straight to the results (skip()). The times and distances are
// CONFIG.consignment.ending. Rendering only draws it (render/cargo.js), from the fields here.
// It only happens where something can show it: `staged` is set by the rendering when it loads, so a
// headless run goes straight to the results as it always did. Not on a level that carries nothing
// (a race, the Battlefield: see cargo.js) nor in a vehicle with no kerb to pull in at
// (CONFIG.consignment.noEnding), nor after any ending but a delivery, on time or late.
