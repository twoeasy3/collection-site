// ---- "what's on this road": a level's gimmicks, pickups and traffic, each with its model turning ---------
// A card over the start screen for the level on the stage (render/menustage.js opens it, and brings this file
// in only when it is first asked for: it carries the reference pages' catalogues and models). Three groups of
// tiles: the level's GIMMICKS (the Gimmicks page's cards that the level has: gimmicks.js, each card's own
// `has`), its PICKUPS (the types laid out on it, levelinfo.js; the power-ups page's wording, powerups.js; and
// what a mystery can be) and its TRAFFIC (what it is driven in, the grid, every vehicle kind in its mix and
// its zones, and the Gimmicks page's cards about vehicles: ambulances, the police pursuit, convoys...). Each
// tile has the model its page shows, a name, and the first line of what its page says.
// Drawn cheaply: ONE WebGL renderer for the whole card, on a canvas off the page, its picture of each tile
// copied into the tile's own small canvas (render/modelviews.js, as the pages do: the models scroll with
// their tiles). The renderer is the start screen's one (the car card's too: sharedRenderer), so the card
// takes no WebGL context of its own; when it closes, what its models took is given back.
// Nothing of the level is built, and the game's own scene is not touched.
