  // the expressway's direction there and arriving at the merge point in the expressway's
  // direction there, so it joins up whatever the expressway does in between (and is a
  // straight line when the two points line up).
  // An exit can then give that curve a shape of its own (CONFIG.ramps.shapeLead, shapeEase: its ramps at
  // each end, and the flyovers laid out along them, are left as they are, the shape easing in beyond them):
  //   out    m its middle is pushed out, away from the expressway (the side road's right): a long way round
  //   bends  { count, size }: that many bends one after the other, right then left..., each swinging the
  //          road `size` m off its line (2 is an S-bend; many, a winding lane)

  //   segments  [{ length, curve }], as a level's own, from the exit on. The side road follows them, and from
  //             where they end, a smooth curve of its own making brings it to the merge: so it always joins

  // And which way its traffic goes: "oncoming" (true on a two-way level, unless it says false; false on a
  // one-way one, unless it says true): its other lane carries traffic coming the other way. Where that
  // traffic comes from is nobody's business: it turns up at the far end and is gone at the near one, unless
  // the exit has "flyovers": true (a two-way level's only), which carry it over from the expressway and back.
