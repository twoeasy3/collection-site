// ============================================================================
// MILESTONES - counters kept across every run in the save (Progress.data.stats, bumped with
// Progress.count), and the milestones they reach: thresholds per counter in CONFIG.milestones, each with
// a title in messages.json (group "milestones", key "<counter>_<threshold>"). Reaching one mid-run says
// it, with a sound. Nothing but bragging rights: the wall on the start screen (render/milestones.js).
// The counters: packagesLanded (packages.js), hipposSurvived (hippos.js), trainsDodged (bullettrain.js),
// and here: copsOutrun, wrecks, busts (watched each step), levelsDelivered and kmDriven (on finish).
