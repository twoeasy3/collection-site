// ============================================================================
// WATER STAGES - a level's "water": [{ from, to, current? }] (see levels.js and CONFIG.water). Over each
// stretch the road IS water: the pavement runs down a slipway into a channel as wide as the road and comes
// back up a slipway at the far end, and its lanes carry on as lanes. Track.water(s) is how deep it is there.
// What it does:
//   - a car that floats (a car's "amphibious"; a boat, a saucer and a tank do too) drives in at speed and
//     carries on as a boat: a lower top speed, less acceleration and braking, softer steering (feel). Nothing
//     stops it at the water's edge. A car that doesn't float crawls and is damaged (it is never meant to be
//     there: an amphibious level is only started in an amphibious car, see Game.start);
//   - a current (a stage's "current") carries a car afloat sideways, and a boat's wake shoves it off the
//     boat's line (push): both are steered against, neither stops anything;
//   - traffic that can't float pulls onto its own shoulder short of the slipway and waits there nose to tail
//     (marshal, holdFor): the queue is on the shoulder, so every lane stays open. Amphibious traffic drives in
//     and out, slower afloat (pace). Boats (a vehicle's "boat") turn up on the water only (allows) and tie up
//     at the bank, the channel's shoulder, short of the slipway at the end of their water.
// A level with no water has none of this: its boats (Oh Mine!'s) go where its traffic does.
// This is what the water does; render/water.js draws it.
