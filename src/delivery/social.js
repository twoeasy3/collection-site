// ============================================================================
// SOCIAL STANDING - a good player's standing with the public, from 0 to 1 (an evil player has none).
// It is won only by gifts that land (on a good driver, or more on a police car) and it drains away
// all the time. The higher it is, the kinder the road (see CONFIG.social): the police see less
// far, fewer drivers are evil (down to a floor) and every new driver arrives happier, the shoulder
// allowance is longer, good powerups (and good mysteries) last longer and bad ones shorter, the
// good mysteries come up more often; past a point the car mends itself a little, and past another,
// a car that assaults the player with a police car about is arrested. A bust costs it dearly, and
// in high standing the police let the player off with a caution instead (see Player.bust).
